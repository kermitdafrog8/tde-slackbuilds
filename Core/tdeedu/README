The Kalzium Chemical Equation Solver needs OCaml, and the FaCiLe module.

tdeedu.SlackBuild checks whether ocaml *and* facile are installed. If not, and the source archives are in the 'src' directory, they are then built, packages created, and installed.

As I'm not aware of any other uses, the builds have not been added to the build list and the source archives will have to be downloaded manually prior to the build. I believe that ocaml and facile are only build-time requirements and if so can be removed when the tdeedu build has completed - but won't know for sure until the crash has been fixed.

If kalzium crashes when trying to use the equation solver, there is an open issue @ https://mirror.git.trinitydesktop.org/gitea/TDE/tdeedu/issues/8.

If it works for you, or the crash is caused by a problem with the build, please raise an issue here to let me know.
