There are issues building with cmake, so until they are resolved, the preference is an autotools build.
If you DO want to build with cmake, run 'USE_CMAKE_MM=yes ./BUILD-TDE.sh'
Juk won't build at all with cmake - the autotools build is more accommodating:

Re: configure output:
"""
* You do not seem to have libmusicbrainz and libtunepimp.
* JuK will be compiled without MusicBrainz support and automatic song recognition will not be supported.
* Please download libmusicbrainz 2.x and libtunepimp 0.3.x from:
* http://www.musicbrainz.org/products/client/download.html
* http://www.musicbrainz.org/products/tunepimp/download.html

And if akode isn't installed:
"""
aKode was not found. Without it the aKode aRts-plugin will not be
installed, and aRts will be unable to play many music formats.
You can find aKode in KDE's Subversion repository under
trunk/tdesupport/akode.
